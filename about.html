        <p>Hi! I'm Marisa Werjefelt, a Swedish American who loves food from all over the world. Based in Brooklyn, I spend most of my 
          free time trying out new recipes or exploring new restaurants.
        
        As the blog curator, I reach out to my favorite fellow foodies and ask for them to contribute to our community whether that be a family heirloom recipe or a post about their 
        favorite cafes in Korea! If you love food, you've come to the right spot. Please note, all our content contributers are paid for their work.</p>
